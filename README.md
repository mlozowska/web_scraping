# web_scraping
1. Based on [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-scraping-python-tutorial/) I've:
- extracted URLs from a [Craigslist webpage](https://boston.craigslist.org/search/sof)
- scraped text data from a webpage;
 - crawled multiple webpages and scraped data from each of them.
 
2. I applied the HTML parsing technique, with  Python libraries: **BeautifulSoup** & **Requests**, to scrape the following Polish job search portals: 
- **Pracuj.pl**
- **nofluffjobs.com**
- **otodom.pl**
